We tested our solver against ring.rkt from Forge 2. The times were as follows: 

SAT: Finding an instance of a ring with 3 nodes took our solver 2.516 seconds, and it took Forge 5 milliseconds
UNSAT: Our solver also returned UNSAT where Forge returned UNSAT (we modified the isRing predicate to be false)

As seen, our solver was notably slower than Forge. This could potentially be due to the fact that we used Python to do this project, and we also had many linear-time operations that recursively added up.
